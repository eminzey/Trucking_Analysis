# Trucking Cost Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the operational costs of different truck models, comparing both electric and diesel trucks. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook and includes data for 1,000 trucks, calculating fuel, maintenance, and total costs over 300 miles.

## Motivation
I have 3 years of experience in the trucking industry, including personally driving and owning a Kenworth T680. This project was inspired by my background, and I aimed to investigate how costs differ between traditional diesel trucks and newer electric models like the Tesla Semi and BYD. MOst people think of fuel costs but dont include maintainance and different kind fluids added to Diesel engines which are costly.
